Step 1: On the host machine type the command
	ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"
	This command creates a private key. The key is given on the terminal itself, in front of SHA256.

Step 2: Send this key to the client

Step 3: On the client machine create the file "authorized_file" in the ".ssh/" folder. Copy the key into this file and save it.

Step 4: From the host machine, type the following command:
	ssh pratik@192.168.43.47
	"ssh user_name_of_client@ip_address_of_the_client"

Step 5: Now the host has access to the client's machine.
